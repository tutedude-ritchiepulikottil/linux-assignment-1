Task 1: Creating and Renaming Files/Directories
•	I created a directory named test_dir using the mkdir command.
•	Inside that directory, I created an empty file called example.txt using the touch command.
•	Then, I renamed example.txt to renamed_example.txt using the mv command.

Task 2: Viewing File Contents
•	I used the cat command to display the full contents of the /etc/passwd file.
•	I used the head command with -n 5 to show only the first 5 lines of the file.
•	I used the tail command with -n 5 to show only the last 5 lines of the file.

Task 4: Zipping and Unzipping
•	I compressed the test_dir directory into a .zip file using the tar and zip command.
•	Then, I created a new directory named unzipped_dir and extracted the zip contents into it using unzip.

Task 5: Downloading Files
•	I used the wget command to download a sample file from a URL. This saves the file to the current directory.
(Note: You can test with any downloadable link, e.g., https://example.com/sample.txt)
